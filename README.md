# Container Orchestration Service Report

## Introduction
This report outlines the implementation and enhancement of a container orchestration service using Golang. The service is designed to efficiently schedule tasks and manage containers across a distributed system. Key features include an advanced scheduling algorithm and persistent storage capabilities.

## Key Features

### 1. Task Scheduling
- **E-PVM Scheduler**: 
  - Implemented the Efficient-Partitioned Virtual Machine (E-PVM) scheduler.
  - The scheduler optimizes task allocation by considering the resources available on each worker node.
  - Ensures efficient distribution of workloads, minimizing resource contention and maximizing performance.

### 2. Container Management
- **Container Orchestration**:
  - Developed a robust system for managing containers across multiple worker nodes.
  - The orchestration service handles the deployment, scaling, and monitoring of containers, ensuring high availability and fault tolerance.

### 3. Persistent Storage
- **BoltDB Integration**:
  - Added persistent storage capabilities using BoltDB, an embedded key-value store.
  - BoltDB provides fast, reliable storage for task metadata, container states, and configuration settings.
  - Enhances the durability and resilience of the orchestration service by maintaining state across restarts and failures.

## Implementation Details

### Technology Stack
- **Programming Language**: Golang
- **Scheduler Algorithm**: E-PVM (Efficient-Partitioned Virtual Machine)
- **Storage System**: BoltDB (Embedded Key-Value Store)

### Challenges and Solutions
- **Resource Management**:
  - Challenge: Efficiently allocating tasks to nodes with varying resource capacities.
  - Solution: Implemented the E-PVM scheduler to optimize resource utilization.

- **Data Persistence**:
  - Challenge: Ensuring data persistence across system failures.
  - Solution: Integrated BoltDB for durable storage of essential data.

## Conclusion
The container orchestration service developed using Golang provides a scalable and efficient solution for managing distributed workloads. The integration of the E-PVM scheduler and BoltDB storage system ensures that tasks are handled efficiently and data integrity is maintained, making the system both robust and reliable.
